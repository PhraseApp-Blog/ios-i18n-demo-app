## iOS i18n Demo App

This is a simple app displaying the solar planet systems we have and developed to help you with internationalizing and localizing an iOS app.

The project is structured in a way that allows you to get a better undestanding of the i18n process if you have a background of using storyboards or programmatic UI or a combination of both in laying out UI components. Whichever method you adopt, you are well covered. Our iOS tutorial will show you how to localize your text content and assets in your iOS app.
